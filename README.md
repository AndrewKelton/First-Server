# First-Server
I made this senior year of high school. Sorry for the poor ReadMe :( <br />
This is a website with some links to different projects I have recently made. 
It is based on a server with port 5001. 
To run the server
I.  goto 'app.py' and run the code. 
II. Paste the link from the terminal into your browser and you will be able to use the website. 
If server does not run. Change port number
